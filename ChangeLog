2023-03-24  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.4 released.

	* Misc: Maintenance work.

2023-02-17  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.3 released.

	* Fix: Special handling or UpdaTA downgrades. An UpdaTA downgrade must
	  be deferred until after all the other packages have been downgraded.
	  This is because UpdaTA may replace its own sudo configuration due to
	  the downgrade, but the downgrade may require those permissions to
	  succeed.

	* Misc: Add test mode so that everything can be simulated.

	* Misc: Fix several warnings thrown by various linters.

2023-01-31  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.2 released.

	* Fix: Support downgrades of library packages which require changing
	  the soname symlink.

	* Logging: Write rotating logs to /var/local/data/updata/, and add
	  timestamps to log entries.

2022-12-16  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.1 released.

	* Fix: Always enable base repository. The build system must disable
	  the repo for building an image, so we need to enable it again.

2022-07-22  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.0 released.

	* Stability: Probe URLs which are put into a strategy.

	* Logging: Improved an error message.

	* Misc: Refactorings.

2021-06-28  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.8 released.

	* Logs: Show reason why no packages were downloaded, if none were
	  downloaded.

	* Stability: Avoid potential use of "len(None)", thus runtime error.

2021-04-30  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.7 released.

	* Functionality: Cumulative offline system updates didn't quite work
	  because dnf doesn't delete one of its temporary files, and keeps
	  updating it. So we delete it by ourselves.

2021-03-24  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.6 released.

	* Functionality: Make offline system updates work. There were several
	  bugs in v0.5 which basically made v0.5 unusable.

2021-03-19  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.5 released.

	* Stability: Use offline system update strategy offered by systemd. We
	  split the update into download and installation phases as suggested
	  by systemd. The download phase is triggered from and monitored by
	  the REST API, after which the system is rebooted into update mode.
	  In that mode, UpdaTA is started as a systemd service and executes
	  the second phase, followed by a reboot into the updated system.

2021-03-11  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.4 released.

	* Logging: Planning and execution components write logs to syslog, not
	  only to stderr. The latter is necessary for observation by the REST
	  API, but syslog is indispensable for the developer.

2021-01-18  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.3 released.

	* Functionality: Remove unnecessary, residual packages during update.

	* Functionality: Do not support dnf-distro-sync anymore for the time
	  being. The server must provide a latest.txt file to make the update
	  process more predictable.

	* Functionality: Add sbin directories to PATH for dnf invocations to
	  make scriptlets work (for depmod, useradd, and possibly more
	  programs used by packages whose installation haven't failed yet).

	* Functionality: Fix up dnf flavor variables in case the variables are
	  detected to be incorrect. The flavor name variable is incorrect when
	  a certain flavor is currently running, but the variable contains a
	  different value. The flavor-enabled variable is incorrect if it
	  indicates that some flavor should (e.g., beta)/should not (stable)
	  be running, but the currently running system disagrees.

	  Most frequently, this kind of mismatch will happen when running off
	  a fresh image made for a certain flavor. This can be triggered by
	  installing a beta image into the recovery area and performing a
	  system recovery.

	* Stability: Skip dnf invocations for empty package lists.

	* Misc: Improved logging of failing external programs.

2020-08-04  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.2 released.

	* Functionality: This version should work on both, V1 and V2 systems,
	  and is compatible with Python 3.4 as shipped with older V1 Streaming
	  Boards. The tools should be functionally complete by now, modulo
	  some bugs.

2020-06-02  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.1 released.

	* First release: First version with setuptools packaging. Packaging
	  works, but the programs are buggy and incomplete.
