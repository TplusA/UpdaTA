	* Version 0.3 released.

	* Functionality: Remove unnecessary, residual packages during update.

	* Functionality: Do not support dnf-distro-sync anymore for the time
	  being. The server must provide a latest.txt file to make the update
	  process more predictable.

	* Functionality: Add sbin directories to PATH for dnf invocations to
	  make scriptlets work (for depmod, useradd, and possibly more
	  programs used by packages whose installation haven't failed yet).

	* Functionality: Fix up dnf flavor variables in case the variables are
	  detected to be incorrect. The flavor name variable is incorrect when
	  a certain flavor is currently running, but the variable contains a
	  different value. The flavor-enabled variable is incorrect if it
	  indicates that some flavor should (e.g., beta)/should not (stable)
	  be running, but the currently running system disagrees.

	  Most frequently, this kind of mismatch will happen when running off
	  a fresh image made for a certain flavor. This can be triggered by
	  installing a beta image into the recovery area and performing a
	  system recovery.

	* Stability: Skip dnf invocations for empty package lists.

	* Misc: Improved logging of failing external programs.

	* Version 0.2 released.

	* Functionality: This version should work on both, V1 and V2 systems,
	  and is compatible with Python 3.4 as shipped with older V1 Streaming
	  Boards. The tools should be functionally complete by now, modulo
	  some bugs.

	* Version 0.1 released.

	* First release: First version with setuptools packaging. Packaging
	  works, but the programs are buggy and incomplete.
